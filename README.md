#  Broton Mapping

Photon Mapping using Metal Performance Shaders and Path Tracing.

# Work to complete

* Rasterization (done)
* Path tracing (done)
* Photon generation (in progress)
* Using photons in path tracer

# How to use

This project requires a Metal-enabled Mac.

There are two demo scenes. Hit '1' for the ring and '2' for the box. Use 'W' and 'S' to move forwards and backwards,
'A' and 'D' to move left and right, and 'Q' and 'E' to move up and down. Click and drag on the window to move the
camera direction around. Hit 'I' to enter rasterization mode, 'O' to enter ray tracing mode.

# How it works
