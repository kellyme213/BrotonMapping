#  Broton Mapping

Photon Mapping using Metal Performance Shaders and Path Tracing.

# How to use

This project requires a Metal-enabled Mac.

There are two demo scenes. Hit '1' for the ring and '2' for the box. Use 'W' and 'S' to move forwards and backwards,
'A' and 'D' to move left and right, and 'Q' and 'E' to move up and down. Click and drag on the window to move the
camera direction around. Hit 'I' to enter rasterization mode, 'O' to enter ray tracing mode, and 'P' to enter photon mapping mode.

Before entering photon mapping mode, you first must generate the photon map. Do this by pressing 'M'. You can visualize the photon map by pressing 'L'. If you can visualize the photon map, you can run the program in photon mapping mode.

Photons are my bros. My brotons.
